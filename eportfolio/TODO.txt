Workflows (WAIT WITH IMPLEMENTATION)
===================
- if yes then a workflow for the journal entries makes sense
  - states: 
      - visible (default)
      - private
  - transitions
      - retract
      - publish
  - security:
      - visible (all project members)
      - private (author only)

Groups vs. Projects (WAIT WITH IMPLEMENTATION)

generic.
